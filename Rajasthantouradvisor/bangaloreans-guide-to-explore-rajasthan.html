                            Magnificent fortifications rising from the desert, opulent mansions, camel trains, and
                            tigers living in the jungles can all be found in the realm of the kings in Udaipur city. But
                            what will really capture the attention of the visitors to this beautiful city are the
                            architectural marvels of the city which are the fascinating fusion of festivals and culture.

                        ITINERARY FOR VISITING RAJASTHAN</h2>
                    <p class="text-color6 my-4">There's a good reason why the Rajasthan path is well-traveled. Beginning
                        in Jaipur, the capital of the area, you will discover a pink-tinged city full of bazaars,
                        magnificent architecture, and massive forts, while Pushkar, a religious lakeside town fragrant
                        with incense, dances to the sounds of puja and chanting. Moving on to another lakefront
                        location, you may cruise by the imposing City Palace in Udaipur before being disoriented in the
                        Blue City of Jodhpur, which unfolds beneath the strong walls of Mehrangarh Fort. Rajasthan is,
                        in our opinion, a vibrant and captivating introduction to India's beauties, and this itinerary
                        will show you the finest of the state. If you want to make the most out of your visit to Udaipur

                        DAY 1 Visiting Jaipur
                    </h2>
                    <p class="text-color6 my-1">The busy streets of the city are a riot of color and activity. Cycle
                        rickshaws dodge automobiles, camels, and the occasional lazy elephant as they wind through
                        clouds of soot and pollution. Motorbikes swarm the city's majestic entrances and bustling
                        marketplaces, honking and buzzing. But millennia of history have laid the foundation for the
                        current metropolis of Jaipur. This is the "Land of the Kings," the domain of maharajas, home to
                        more magnificent forts and sumptuous palaces than any other place in India. There are still
                        magnificent remnants of Rajasthan's past to discover. The magnificent City Palace, which still
                        houses the previous royal family, is located in the heart of Jaipur and is an oasis of peace;
                        the magnificent Hawa Mahal, with its honeycomb facade, towers above a congested road.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-color6 my-2">Following a hearty breakfast, you will only be a short walk from some of
                        Jaipur's main
                        attractions. Of these attractions, the City Palace is undoubtedly the star and with good reason.
                        Situated right in the centre of the old city, you enter through the pink outer walls to find a
                        maze-like complex of gardens, courtyards and buildings. The original outer wall was built by Jai
                        Singh but the interior has been added to and enlarged over the years, with different buildings
                        and palaces deriving from different centuries. Plan your visit to the beautiful cities of
                        Rajasthan like Jaipur and Udaipur with <a class="text-color1"

                    <p class="text-color6 my-2">
                        After a filling breakfast, several of Jaipur's top attractions are just a short stroll away.
                        With good cause, the City Palace is without a doubt the most popular of these attractions.
                        Located directly in the heart of the old city, this complex of gardens, courtyards, and
                        buildings resembles a maze when you go through the pink exterior walls. Jai Singh constructed
                        the exterior wall when it was first constructed, but other structures and palaces from various
                        eras have been constructed added to and expanded upon inside over time.

                        Palace, a massive monument and a must-see location in Udaipur. Constructed in 1559 by Maharana
                        Udai Singh II, this palace is one of the biggest in Rajasthan and is situated on a hilltop with
                        a view of the city. In most of India, kings are referred to as Maharajas; but, in Udaipur,
                        Rajput kings are known as Maharanas. Over the course of the next 400 years, the City Palace
                        expanded as 42 different Maharanas left their imprint by constructing additional palaces, or
                        Mahals. Inside are eleven distinct palaces, the majority of which are now museums featuring
                        artwork and furnishings owned by the Royal family. Aside from Fateh Prakash and Shiv Niwas
